Interventions in Saajha Impact schools are directly led by the team members of the
Saajha. There are three kinds of interventions undertaken in these schools –
<ol>
<li>Inside school interventions – These interventions focus on facilitation of the SMC meetings and activities for building leadership capabilities of the school staff.
</li>
<li>Community engagement activities – These activities focus on raising awareness about parental and community engagement in children learning.
</li>
<li>Biannual workshops – Saajha conducts biannual workshops which form a platform for the SMCs across the zones to interact with each other and share their learning experiences.
</li>
</ol>

<p>Saajha&#39;s interventions are led by a team of facilitators, with each facilitator undertaking 12 school visits across 8 schools and one community visit every week. A team of 4-5 facilitators is led by a Cohort leader who is tasked with providing strategic guidance to the interventions in schools. Saajha currently operates in 87 schools through Saajha Impact Schools model.

<h3>Saajhedar Schools</h3>
<p>Saajha is actively looking at partnerships to implement the SMC leadership-building module across the country. In Saajhedar schools, Saajha works with a partner to build effective practices of SMC strengthening. A major initiative with regard to Saajhedar schools has been Saajha&#39;s partnership with Delhi government to build capacity of SMCs across the state. Delhi currently has 1207 schools. To transform the status quo of SMCs across the state, Saajha has devised a three-pronged approach which would focus on building capabilities of the trainers and volunteers who could in turn build capabilities of the School Management committees.
