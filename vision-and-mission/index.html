  <!-- <h3 class="text-center text-primary">Saajhaâ€™s mission is two-fold:</h3>
  <p><span class="h1 text-primary">#1</span>
  Build leadership in schools and communities to impact student learning outcomes in public schools of India. For improving the engagement, Saajha aims to build leadership capabilities of the School Management Committees (SMCs), mandatory bodies under the Indian Right to Education Act, 2009, comprising of elected teachers, parents and members of the community in all public primary schools. By bridging the skill-gap in leadership, Saajha aims to facilitate a collaborative approach between the schools and the community, and ensure parental and community engagement in monitoring of fundamental parameters related to learning of children like teacher attendance and student learning levels. This would enable the SMCs to evolve into a transformational force ensuring better learning outcomes from the currently dysfunctional state.</p>
  <p><span class="h2 text-primary">#2</span>
  Facilitate peer learning among the SMCs by enabling formation of a peer-engagement network of these committees. This would allow the committees to learn from experiences of each other and collaborate for addressing complex challenges for improvement in learning outcomes of the schools.</p> -->

  <h3 class="text-center text-primary"><b>Saajha&#39;s Vision</b></h3>
  <p>
<blockquote><em>Saajha aims to build a national level peer engagement platform of<span class="text-saajha"> 100,000 </span>School Management Committees (SMCs) across the country. This national level network would span 8 states and 200 districts, and would benefit more than <span class="text-saajha"> 150 million</span> children studying in public primary schools in the country.
</em></blockquote>
This would also enable collaboration among the SMCs at national level, which would allow them to share learning experiences from across the country, and therefore, ensuring sustainability of the intervention. The platform would also give the SMCs sufficient leverage to push for systemic and instutional reforms for facilitating regulatory support to community engagement.
