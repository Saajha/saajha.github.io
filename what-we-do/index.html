  <!-- <h3 class="text-center text-primary">Saajha’s mission is two-fold:</h3>
  <p><span class="h1 text-primary">#1</span>
  Build leadership in schools and communities to impact student learning outcomes in public schools of India. For improving the engagement, Saajha aims to build leadership capabilities of the School Management Committees (SMCs), mandatory bodies under the Indian Right to Education Act, 2009, comprising of elected teachers, parents and members of the community in all public primary schools. By bridging the skill-gap in leadership, Saajha aims to facilitate a collaborative approach between the schools and the community, and ensure parental and community engagement in monitoring of fundamental parameters related to learning of children like teacher attendance and student learning levels. This would enable the SMCs to evolve into a transformational force ensuring better learning outcomes from the currently dysfunctional state.</p>
  <p><span class="h2 text-primary">#2</span>
  Facilitate peer learning among the SMCs by enabling formation of a peer-engagement network of these committees. This would allow the committees to learn from experiences of each other and collaborate for addressing complex challenges for improvement in learning outcomes of the schools.</p> -->

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-12 box-outline">
  <h3 class="text-center text-primary"><b>Saajha&#39;s Vision</b></h3>
  <p>
<blockquote><em>Saajha aims to build a national level peer engagement platform of<span class="text-saajha"> 100,000 </span>School Management Committees (SMCs) across the country. This national level network would span 8 states and 200 districts, and would benefit more than <span class="text-saajha"> 150 million</span> children studying in public primary schools in the country.
</em></blockquote>
This would also enable collaboration among the SMCs at national level, which would allow them to share learning experiences from across the country, and therefore, ensuring sustainability of the intervention. The platform would also give the SMCs sufficient leverage to push for systemic and instutional reforms for facilitating regulatory support to community engagement.

<h3>Saajha Impact Schools</h3>
<p>Saajha&#39;s inside school interventions, outside school interventions and biannual workshops have resulted in an improvement in both, leadership capabilities of the School Management Committees and improvement in learning outcomes.</p>

</div>
Interventions in Saajha Impact schools are directly led by the team members of the
Saajha. There are three kinds of interventions undertaken in these schools –
<ol>
<li>Inside school interventions – These interventions focus on facilitation of the SMC meetings and activities for building leadership capabilities of the school staff.
</li>
<li>Community engagement activities – These activities focus on raising awareness about parental and community engagement in children learning.
</li>
<li>Biannual workshops – Saajha conducts biannual workshops which form a platform for the SMCs across the zones to interact with each other and share their learning experiences.
</li>
</ol>

<p>Saajha&#39;s interventions are led by a team of facilitators, with each facilitator undertaking 12 school visits across 8 schools and one community visit every week. A team of 4-5 facilitators is led by a Cohort leader who is tasked with providing strategic guidance to the interventions in schools. Saajha currently operates in 87 schools through Saajha Impact Schools model.

<h3>Saajhedar Schools</h3>
<p>Saajha is actively looking at partnerships to implement the SMC leadership-building module across the country. In Saajhedar schools, Saajha works with a partner to build effective practices of SMC strengthening. A major initiative with regard to Saajhedar schools has been Saajha&#39;s partnership with Delhi government to build capacity of SMCs across the state. Delhi currently has 1207 schools. To transform the status quo of SMCs across the state, Saajha has devised a three-pronged approach which would focus on building capabilities of the trainers and volunteers who could in turn build capabilities of the School Management committees.
